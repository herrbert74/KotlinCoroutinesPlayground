/**
 * To understand why the result is not 1,000,000, imagine a scenario in which two threads try to increment the same
 * number at the same time. Letâ€™s say that the initial value is 0. The first thread takes the current value 0,
 * and then the processor decides to switch to the second thread. The second thread takes 0 as well,
 * increments it to 1, and stores it in the variable. We switch to the first thread where it has finished: it has 0,
 * so it increments it to 1 and stores it. As a result, the variable is 1 but it should be 2.
 * This is how some operations are lost.
