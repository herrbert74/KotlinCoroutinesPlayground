/**
 * In practice, this approach can be used in two ways. The first approach is known as coarse-grained thread confinement.
 * This is an easy approach whereby we just wrap the whole function with withContext,
 * with a dispatcher limited to a single thread. This solution is easy and eliminates conflicts,
 * but the problem is that we lose the multithreading capabilities of the whole function.
 * Letâ€™s take a look at the example below. api.fetchUser(id) could be started concurrently on many threads,
 * but its body will be running on a dispatcher that is limited to a single thread.
 * As a result, this function execution could slow down when we invoke functions that are blocking or CPU-intensive.
