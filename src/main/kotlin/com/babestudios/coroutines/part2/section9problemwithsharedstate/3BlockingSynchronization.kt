/**
 * The problem above can be solved using classic tools we know from Java, like synchronized block or synchronized
 * collections.
 *
 * This solution works, but there are a few problems.
 * The biggest one is, that inside synchronized block you cannot use suspending functions.
 * The second one is, that this block is blocking threads when a coroutine is waiting for its turn.
 * I hope that after the chapter about dispatchers you understand that we do not want to block threads.
 * What if it is the main thread? What if we only have a limited pool of threads? Why waste these resources?
 * We should use coroutine- specific tools instead. Ones that do not block but instead suspend or avoid conflict.
 * So, letâ€™s set aside this solution and explore some others.
