/**
 * How does it work? Imagine an unlimited pool of threads. Initially, it is empty, but as we need more threads,
 * they are created and kept active until they are not used for some time. Such a pool exists, but it wouldnâ€™t be safe
 * to use it directly. With too many active threads, the performance degrades in a slow but unlimited manner,
 * eventually causing out-of-memory errors. This is why we create dispatchers that have a limited number of threads
 * they can use at the same time. Dispatchers.Default is limited by the number of cores in your processor.
 * The limit of Dispatchers.IO is 64 (or the number of cores if there are more).
