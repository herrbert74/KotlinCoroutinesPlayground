/**
 * A better approach would be to join all the current children of the job.

 * Job() is a great example of a factory function. At first, you might think that youâ€™re calling a constructor of Job,
 * but you might then realize that Job is an interface, and interfaces cannot have constructors.
 * The reality is that it is a fake constructor - a simple function that looks like a constructor.
 * Moreover, the actual type returned by this function is not a Job but its subinterface CompletableJob.
