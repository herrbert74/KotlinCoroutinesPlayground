/**
 * A Job can be created without a coroutine using the Job() factory function.
 * It creates a job that isnâ€™t associated with any coroutine and can be used as a context.
 * This also means that we can use such a job as a parent of many coroutines.
 *
 * A common mistake is to create a job using the Job() factory function, use it as a parent for some coroutines,
 * and then use join on the job. Such a program will never end because Job is still in an active state,
 * even when all its children are finished. This is because this context is still ready to be used by other coroutines.
