/**
 * A very important part of how coroutines behave is their exception handling.
 * Just as a program breaks when an uncaught exception slips by,
 * a coroutine breaks in the case of an uncaught exception.
 * This behavior is nothing new: for instance, threads also end in such cases.
 * The difference is that coroutine builders also cancel their parents,
 * and each cancelled parent cancels all its children.
 * Letâ€™s look at the example below. Once a coroutine receives an exception,
 * it cancels itself and propagates the exception to its parent (launch).
 * The parent cancels itself and all its children, then it propagates the exception to its parent (runBlocking).
 * runBlocking is a root coroutine (it has no parent), so it just ends the program (runBlocking rethrows the exception).
