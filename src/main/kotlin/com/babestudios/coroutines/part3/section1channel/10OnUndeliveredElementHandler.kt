 * One more Channel function parameter which we should know about is onUndeliveredElement.
 * It is called when an element couldnâ€™t be handled for some reason. Most often this means that a channel was closed
 * or cancelled, but it might also happen when send, receive, receiveOrNull, or hasNext throw an error.
 * We generally use it to close resources that are sent by this channel.

 * NO WORKING EXAMPLE
