/**
 * Flow is often used to observe changes, like user actions, database modifications, or new messages. We already know
 * the different ways in which these events can be processed and handled. Weâ€™ve learned how to merge multiple flows
 * into one. But what if multiple classes are interested in these changes, and we would like to turn one flow into
 * multiple flows? The solution is SharedFlow, and the easiest way to turn a Flow into a SharedFlow is by using the
 * shareIn function.

/**
 * The shareIn function creates a SharedFlow and sends elements from its Flow. Since we need to start a coroutine to
 * collect elements on flow, shareIn expects a coroutine scope as the first argument. The third argument is replay,
 * which is 0 by default. The second argument is interesting: started determines when listening for values should start,
 * depending on the number of listeners. The following options are supported (NEXT FILES):
