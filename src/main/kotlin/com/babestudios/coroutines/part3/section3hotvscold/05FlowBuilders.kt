/**
 * The same processing using Flow is very different. Since it is a cold data source, the production happens on demand.
 * This means that flow is not a builder and does no processing. It is only a definition of how elements should be
 * produced that will be used when a terminal operation (like collect) is used. This is why the flow builder does not
 * need a CoroutineScope. It will run in the scope from the terminal operation that executed it (it takes the scope
 * from the suspending functionâ€™s continuation, just like coroutineScope and other coroutine scope functions).
 * Each terminal operation on a flow starts processing from scratch. Compare the examples above and below because
 * they show the key differences between Channel and Flow.
