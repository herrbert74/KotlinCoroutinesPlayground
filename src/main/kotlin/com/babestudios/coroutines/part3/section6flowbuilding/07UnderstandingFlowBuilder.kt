/**
 * When we call a flow builder, we just create an object. However, calling collect means calling the block function
 * on the collector interface. The block function in this example is the lambda expression defined at 1.
 * Its receiver is the collector, which is defined at 2 with a lambda expression. When we define a function interface
 * (like FlowCollector) using a lambda expression, the body of this lambda expression will be used as the implementation
 * of the only function expected by this interface, that is emit in this case. So, the body of the emit function is
 * println(value). Thus, when we call collect, we start executing the lambda expression defined at 1, and when it
 * calls emit, it calls the lambda expression defined at 2. This is how flow works. Everything else is built on top of
 * that.
