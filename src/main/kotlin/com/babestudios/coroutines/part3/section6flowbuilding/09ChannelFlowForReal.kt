/**
 * On the other hand, we might have cases in which we want to fetch pages in advance when we are still processing the
 * elements. Doing this in the presented case could lead to more network calls, but it might also produce a faster
 * result. To achieve this, we would need independent production and consumption. Such independence is typical of
 * hot data streams, like channels. So, we need a hybrid of Channel and Flow. Yes, this is supported: we just need to
 * use the channelFlow function, which is like Flow because it implements the Flow interface. This builder is a regular
 * function, and it is started with a terminal operation (like collect). It is also like a Channel because once it is
 * started, it produces the values in a separate coroutine without waiting for the receiver. Therefore, fetching the
 * next pages and checking users happens concurrently.
