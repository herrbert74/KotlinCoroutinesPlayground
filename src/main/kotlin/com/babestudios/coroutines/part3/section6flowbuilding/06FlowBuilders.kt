/**
 * The most popular way to make a flow is using the flow builder, which weâ€™ve already used in previous chapters.
 * It behaves similarly to sequence builder for building a sequence, or produce builder for building a channel.
 * We start the builder with the flow function call, and inside its lambda expression we emit the next values using the
 * emit function. We can also use emitAll to emit all the values from Channel or Flow (emitAll(flow) is shorthand for
 * flow.collect { emit(it) }).
