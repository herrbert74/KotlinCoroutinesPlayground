/**
 * Flow can be considered a bit more complicated than suspending lambda expressions with a receiver.
 * However, its power lies in all the functions defined for its creation, processing, and observation.
 * Most of them are actually very simple under the hood.
 * We will learn about them in the next chapters, but I want you to have the intuition that most of them are very
 * simple and can be easily constructed using flow, collect, and emit.
 *
 * Consider the map function that transforms each element of a flow. It creates a new flow, so it uses the flow builder.
 * When its flow is started, it needs to start the flow it wraps; so, inside the builder, it calls the collect method.
 * Whenever an element is received, map transforms this element and then emits it to the new flow.
