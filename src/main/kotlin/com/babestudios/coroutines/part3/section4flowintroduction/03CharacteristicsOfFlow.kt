/**
 * Flowâ€™s terminal operations (like collect) suspend a coroutine instead of blocking a thread.
 * They also support other coroutine functionalities, such as respecting the coroutine context and handling exceptions.
 * Flow processing can be cancelled, and structured concurrency is supported out of the box. The flow builder is not
 * suspending and does not require any scope. It is the terminal operation that is suspending and builds a relation to
 * its parent coroutine (similar to the coroutineScope function).
 * The below example shows how CoroutineName context is passed from collect to the lambda expression in the flow
 * builder. It also shows that launch cancellation also leads to proper flow processing cancellation.
