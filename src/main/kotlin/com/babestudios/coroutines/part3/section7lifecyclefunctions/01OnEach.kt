/**
 * Flow can be imagined as a pipe in which requests for next values flow in one direction, and the corresponding
 * produced values flow in the other direction. When flow is completed or an exception occurs, this information is
 * also propagated, and it closes the intermediate steps on the way. So, as they all flow, we can listen for values,
 * exceptions, or other characteristic events (like starting or completing). To do this, we use methods such as onEach,
 * onStart, onCompletion, onEmpty and catch. Letâ€™s explain these one by one.
 *
 * To react to each flowing value, we use the onEach function.
 *
 * The onEach lambda expression is suspending, and elements are processed one after another in order (sequentially).
 * So, if we add delay in onEach, we will delay each value as it flows.
